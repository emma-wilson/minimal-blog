Use Markdown to write your blog posts. You can use various Markdown styles to style your posts, including:

### Heading levels

Start with Headig level 3 as Heading Level 1 is used by the site title and Heading Level 2 is used by the post title. You don't need to add the post title to this file the Markdown file title will be used e.g. My Frst Blog.

### Bullet lists

You can create bullet lists to show information more clearly:

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

You can also use numbered lists:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

### Code

You can use one backtick to `write inline code` and three backticks to create code blocks:

```
1+1
```
