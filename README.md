## Using this template

To build your own website using this template:

### Step 1: Fork this repository

Fork this repository and change the name to `your-username.github.io`. This will also be the URL of your new website.

### Step 2: Customise your website

First, customise the information in the `_config.yml` file. This will allow you to edit the site title and social links. To change the profile picture, replace the image file in `assets/img`.

You can edit the site content in the Markdown files, e.g, `index.md`, and add publications and resources using the `publications.yml` and `resources.yml` files in the `_data` folder.

## Step 3: Add blog posts

Create and edit blog posts in the `_posts` folder.

## Step 4: Additional customisation

You can edit the HTML and CSS files in this repository to edit other parts of your website. For instance, in `assets/css/styles.css` you can edit `--primary-color` and `--secondary-color` variables to change the website colours.
